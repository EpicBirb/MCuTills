# Creating a Pull Requests

Creating a pull request is quite simple since there is litteraly a scetion for creating one. So I made some rules before you actually commit to the repository!

<br>

Here are some rule that you NEED to follow before committing:

- You must enable "Vigilant Mode" in your settings. (Settings > SSH and GPG keys > Vigilant mode)

- You must sign the commit with your verified signature (Github Docs has a great explanation on how to generate a GPG key and get your commit signed, Click this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification) to follow)

- Commits CAN'T be signed using Github's verified signature (It means that you can't make changes directly on the [Github](https://github.com)

- AND you must state the changes you made in the pull request

### Hopefuly this will go well :)
